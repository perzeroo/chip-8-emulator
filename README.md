# Chip-8 Emulator
A Chip-8 emulator written in Rust. It currently only loads a ROM to the virtual memory. It is able to perform the first 11 out of 35 instructions (Counting the 0NNN instruction as a NOP).

# TBA
Implement the rest of the instruction set, use Macroquad to render the graphics. Potentially implement dynamic recompilation.
